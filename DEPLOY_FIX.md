# ðŸš¨ Deployment Fix Applied - Version 2

## Issue: TensorFlow Python 3.13 Compatibility

### Problem:
- Streamlit Cloud is using Python 3.13.5 (cannot be overridden)
- TensorFlow stable versions don't support Python 3.13 yet
- Only pre-release versions available for Python 3.13

### Solution Applied (V2):

1. **Using TensorFlow Pre-release**: `tensorflow==2.20.0rc0`
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added robust TensorFlow import and loading
3. **Model Loading Improvements**: 
   - Skip compilation during load
   - Recompile with safe settings
   - Better error messages

3. **Current Requirements (Fixed):**
   ```
   streamlit==1.28.0
   tensorflow==2.20.0rc0  # Pre-release for Python 3.13 support
   Pillow>=10.0.0         # Allow version flexibility for builds
   numpy>=1.26.0          # Compatible with TF 2.20
   protobuf>=5.28.0       # Required by TensorFlow 2.20.0rc0
   ```

### Code Enhancements:
- âœ… TensorFlow import error handling
- âœ… Memory optimization for cloud deployment
- âœ… Model loading with `compile=False` then recompile
- âœ… Better user feedback for errors

### Why This Should Work:
- **Pre-release TensorFlow**: Only version available for Python 3.13
- **Robust error handling**: Graceful fallbacks if issues occur
- **Streamlit Cloud compatible**: Tested approach for current environment

### Expected Result:
âœ… Deployment should succeed with TensorFlow 2.20.0rc0
âœ… Model loading should work with enhanced error handling

*Using pre-release version until stable TensorFlow supports Python 3.13*
