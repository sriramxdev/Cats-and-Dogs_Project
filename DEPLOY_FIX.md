# ðŸš¨ Deployment Fix Applied

## Issue Resolved: TensorFlow Compatibility

### Problem:
- Streamlit Cloud was using Python 3.13.5
- TensorFlow 2.13+ doesn't have stable wheels for Python 3.13
- Deployment failed during dependency installation

### Solution Applied:

1. **Added `runtime.txt`** - Forces Python 3.11 usage
2. **Updated `requirements.txt`** with compatible versions:
   - `tensorflow-cpu==2.13.1` (CPU-only, smaller, faster for inference)
   - Fixed versions for all dependencies
   - Added protobuf version constraint

3. **Key Changes:**
   ```
   streamlit==1.28.0
   tensorflow-cpu==2.13.1  # CPU version for cloud deployment
   Pillow==10.0.1
   numpy==1.24.3
   protobuf==4.23.4
   ```

### Why These Versions:
- **Python 3.11**: Stable, widely supported by all ML libraries
- **TensorFlow CPU**: Lighter than GPU version, perfect for inference
- **Fixed versions**: Prevents future compatibility breaks
- **Protobuf constraint**: Avoids TensorFlow conflicts

### Expected Result:
âœ… Deployment should now succeed on Streamlit Community Cloud

### If Still Issues:
1. Check Streamlit Cloud logs for specific errors
2. Try restarting the deployment
3. Verify Git LFS is properly tracking the model file
