# Alternative Deployment Strategy

If TensorFlow 2.20.0rc0 still fails, here are backup options:

## Option 1: Use tf-keras-nightly
```
streamlit==1.28.0
tf-keras-nightly
Pillow==10.0.1
numpy==1.26.0
```

## Option 2: Wait for Python Version Update
Streamlit Cloud may update to support older Python versions or TensorFlow may release stable version for 3.13.

## Option 3: Use TensorFlow.js (Radical Alternative)
Convert model to TensorFlow.js format and use different inference approach.

## Current Status: Testing TensorFlow 2.20.0rc0
This pre-release version should work with Python 3.13.5.
